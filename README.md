# SetupManager
Setup Manager for me and my guild <constant>

This Addon sole purpose is to be used with out guild sheet. The format can be seen below - you can recreate our setup string which follows the schemata:
- Boss1:Rilla,Rillaw,Rillaw;Boss:Rillad,Rillap,Wehatelua;Boss3:[...]


Requires NS Database & Functions and a full database for your guild. If you have none at all you will most likely run into bugs or may not be able to use it at all. Sorry!
I may look into a solution without but for the time being it is a dependency. 

As of 24th Macrch this is a very early version - expect to have bugs, unhandeld scenarios etc. If you run into a bug, feel free to open an issue or dm me on discord: .rilla



As of right now I will not make our guild sheet public - but maybe in the future! Current features:
- own evaluation of droptimizer inside sheet
- see wowAudit Data inside the sheet
- add droptimizers to wishlist out of the sheet
- build your setup (see vault, see missing buffs, 
- see individual item gain
- see crests / upgrade information (is someone on crestCap, how much does he have left to spend etc and much more)
- support for splits
- see how worth it is to run splits
- dynamically handle config and users
- and much more.. a lot of automization as I no longer wanted to manually maintain something or didn't want to check multiple sheets/sites etc

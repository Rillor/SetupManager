# SetupManager
Setup Manager for me and my guild <constant>

This Addon sole purpose is to be used with out guild sheet. You can recreate our setup string which follows the schemata:
- Boss1:Rilla,Rillaw,Rillaw;Boss:Rillad,Rillap,Wehatelua;Boss3:[...]

Requires NS Database & Functions and a full database for your guild. If you have none at all you will most likely run into bugs or may not be able to use it at all. Sorry!
I may look into a solution without but for the time being it is a dependency.

As of 18th February this is a very early version - expect to have bugs, unhandeld scenarios etc. If you run into a bug, feel free to open an issue or dm me on discord: .rilla

# SetupManager
Setup Manager for me and my guild

This Addon sole purpose is to be used with guild sheet. The format can be seen below - you can recreate our setup string which follows the schemata:
- Boss1:Rilla,Rillaw,Rillaw;Boss;Boss2:Rillad,Rillap,Wehatelua;Boss3:[...]

29.03.2025 - refactored code to make it work without nicknames.
Alt functionality requires NorthernSky Raid Tools and requires said characters to be in the guild.

This is a solely personal use addon, I am happy to fix erros/bugs if you encounter them.
